# 0*. details

## Mrk335
  
  {18}   不处理pile-up(0/800)，数值2.2%。光变曲线显示计数率非常低，去除后15000s。PSD情况非常平。
  
  {19}   数据背景flare影响过大。
  

## 1H0707-495
  
  {02}      rate有负数(?)。去除前1600s。PSD纵轴数值奇怪。
  
  {08-1}  光曲去除前4500s、后5500s。
  
  {08-2}  SAS出现问题。
  
  {08-3}  背景flare整体rate很大(?)。
  
  {10-1}  pile-up不太理想，扣除区域200/800，数值3.2%。光曲去除后1900s。PSD情况与Mrk335(09)类似。
  
  {10-2}  pile-up 330/800，数值2.5%。光曲去除后31150s。
  
  {11}     数据背景flare较多。

## PG1244+026

  {11}    flare rate极小。小窗口模式。pile-up 100/800。
  
  {14-1}  无PN数据。
  
  {14-2}  小窗口模式。不处理pile-up，数值2.0%，去除后29550s。
  
  {14-4}  背景flare影响明显。
  
  {15}    小窗口模式。pile-up 60/800，去除前3000s。
